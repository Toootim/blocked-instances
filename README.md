List of Toot CafÃ© blocked instances
=======

This is a list of Mastodon/GNU Social instances blocked by [toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe). If you think an instance has been unfairly blocked, please open an issue and/or a pull request.

The purpose of this is to be transparent and to collaborate with other admins on identifying those instances that violate the commonly-accepted Code of Conduct in the Mastodon community based on [the example set by mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/about/more), or those that tend to contain bad actors who do, and who boost unwanted content into other instances.

Notes on our instance
-----

- We don't accept hate speech.
- We don't accept violent nationalism or National Socialism.
- We are not a "free speech zone."
- We come from a different cultural heritage than many of the GNU Social instances.
- We pass no judgment on those that do, but our users may not want to engage with such content. This is what alt accounts are for. ðŸ˜‰
